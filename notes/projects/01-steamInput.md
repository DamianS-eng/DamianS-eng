# Steam Input

## The goal
Provide a complete playlist that explores and explains the fundamentals of Steam Input in a objective, concrete method.

## Does this already exist?

While there are plenty of YouTube videos and playlists that already exist which examine Steam Input and the Steam Controller in-depth, there are several problems across one or more of these sources:

1. Outdated 
	(Blue Big Picture Mode is gone.)
1. Rambling or Spiteful
1. Brilliant but not complete
	for ideas on Steam Controller, not for concrete objective reference to Steam Input

## The Plan

1. The First Step Video (Step 1, First Step, Getting Started)
  - The point of focusing on this is SEO. YouTube prioritizes the first and last steps in its algorithm before recommending playlists. Subscriptions spawn from this video.
1. The Playlist Outline (this video, top of the playlist, Step 0)
1. Steam Controller (less priority)
1. Steam Link (low priority)
1. Three groups of controllers
 1. First-Party Support
  1. Xbox 360 Controller (x-input de facto)
  1. Xbox One /  Series
 1. Feature Complete
  1. Steam Controller / Steam Deck
  1. Sony Playstation
  1. Nintendo Switch 
   1. Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons (low priority due to beta support)
1. DualShock4 (the priority)
1. The Gaming Mode
 1. How to switch to Desktop Layout
1. The Desktop Layout (and how to get to settings)
 1. How to switch to Gaming Mode
 1. Account for menu settings that rely on Gaming Mode
1. Controller Configurator
 1. Overview (VERY basic, don't go into menus)
 1. Deeper Dive (explore
