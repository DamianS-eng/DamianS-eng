# A Critic and a Warning on Soulcreek

Tags: [[ramblings]]  [[script]]  [[novel]]

# Disclaimer

Please forgive both the content and the structure of this post as I write it, because this is going to be a raw, disjointed rambling about the reaction I have to the visual novel Soulcreek.

# Intro

First to explain, Soulcreek is a furry horror-genre visual novel, a complete story with only one canon ending and some protagonist choices for some flavor but ultimately change nothing. As a horror story, it's excellent. This is a novel that definitely reaches deep into the human psyche and makes asome dramatic observations about the questions of rage, fear and trauma. 

I highly recommend avoiding this novel for one critical issue: the main story doesn't fulfill the purpose it intends from the hook. Despite the lore, the central intention is the release of the graphic content, both in its cgs and in the interim scenes, which are artistic forms of expression to an elevated, negative and graphic extreme, with very little purpose in reciting or sharing without undoing uneeded harm or stress.

# Promise

In the beginning, there is very good promise. World building, character introductions, expansion via exploration. Of course, we can't forget the relationship built between the protagonist and the main supporting role. There are many genuine moments worth experiencing that any relationshp would love. Discussions, teachings, banters, cuddles, support, ~~the x-rated stuff~~; all the good and the bad expressed with the visuals are phenominal.

# Problems

But the main problems storm in with both the story focus and its handling of the central character, with both lack of explanation and full of overexplanation. 

## Lack of explanation

This problem starts and persists throughout the entire story with a literal deus ex machina, a support character with glaring potential but abrupt limitations when inconvenient. Doesn't help also that the character is chastized for its lack of emotion, as that is meant to be a pun on the machine bit, but the value is that the character's interaction with the protagonist would change the latter in a meaningful way. And there are several pitiful attempts at this throughtout the story, especially as the protagonist is struggling with the consequences of his choices, but these are frequently ignored or outright challenged for the sake of adding additonal horror element. It makes the entire point of this bit as a support character, whose relative clone then becomes a central antagonist, less of an influence on the protagonist and more of a medium to find horror elements to show off.

It also does not help that the central conflict not only attacks our protagonist and supporting cast without remorse or consequence, but also evolves in ways that are unimaginable and inconsistent to what's previously demonstrated or explored. The horror starts on the unknown, but it feeds and returns on surprises after surprises, to the point where any path of resolution is constantly meaningless in the end. It's never clear by the climatic turning point if the central threat lingers any more or if hell has arrived and isn't going anywhere by any means. It doesn't demonstrate proper story telling; it's an edgy outlet for raw and artistic emotion. While it's a miracle that several of the cast and their relationships barely survive in the end, the promise of a life somewhat worth living in this world, either for the world itself or the relationships within, is ulimately drowned in gore and apathy.

## Poor Character Handling

### The main is unlikable

The protagonist, with a sudden change from naivety to unfiltered and unredeeming output, is an additional drag that upsets the story. The novel takes place in first person, with the protagonist stripped of his memories and his apparent abilities. This gives plenty of room for world building and character development in the beginning, but as pieces of the past return, the protagonist immediately adopts a jagged, partisan and selfish stance on vengeance. All that world-building and relationship development is brushed aside to harness this horrific truth in its utmost graphical nature. In fact, there are constant reminders of regret for exploration: "Why did we pursue the truth? Should we never pursue the truth? It's bad to pursue the truth!" But what __must__ be clarified is this: each promise of a truth is a trap set to surprise the reader with routine graphic horror, nothing else. No merit, no resolution, no redemption. There was never a promise worth fulfilling, but that, rather, is a trap for the reader to witness the shallow desposition of the character into a potential villian for a world that never deserves it.

The supporting character's trauma is much more impactful than both the grief from the trauma that the protagonist is reminded of, and the remorse that the protagonist ultimately experiences. The remorse takes a very long time to occur when he ends up betraying everyone around him to fulfill the choice he makes to express his grief, and it's especially frustrating to the reader when both the protagonist simply, without hesitation, chooses to hide the truth from all cast with which he has a relationship (all while deceiving himself with flawed reasons that are both repeated and never challenged), and the cast around the protagonist do not make any attempt to interrupt or influence the protagonist. He never must accept the ultimate power he apparently desired, but was rather allowed when the pacing required more horror to demonstrate. It's most frustrating when this is all demonstrated from a first person perspective, and this gaslights the reader  to express shallow points of failure and regret while missing valid, deeper and critical moments of reflection from someone more meaningful like the supporting character. The protagonist is influenced by the horror from the deus ex machina, indeed, but they are given several opportunities to develop or expand their relationships based on their reaction to the conflict, but simply chooses not to and adamantly takes this one stance that ruins him, the supporting cast, and the relationships promised as cherishable since the beginning.

Much of the grief the protagonist experieneces is assumed because both the protagonist and the reader do not know anything about any past relationship that has caused the grief. This never even gets resolved as both the protagonist and the reader receive pieces of the memories back. All that's left for the reader is generalized expectations of the grief the protagonist experiences, as well as the reactions and choices he makes, no matter how painful, redundant or shallow they are. The reader is expected to know how one must grieve, but a reader cursed with the knowledge of other examples to grieve or regret will be frustrated for too long with all the mistakes this protagonist makes. Whereas the devleopment put into the support character's relationship with others around him demonstrate a better buildup to the grief he will ultimately experience. Perhaps this is intended as a simple juxaposition, but given the horror genre's intention to express as much intense art as possible, it was much more preferred to dwell on the consequences than to demonstrate the options. That alternative is completely missing from the protagonist's perspective, and the story suffers because of it. Simply put: Loken is much more believable than Alex.
 
### The support, not the main, redeems

Loken, the other important support character is the opposite; he's quite well structured and appealing to observe. In fact, he's quite the central draw to the main story, as both his ambition and his weakness are both apparent and explored as the story progresses, with much faith that he will evolve into a worthwhile example, perhaps one that most outside the relationship or this story strive to be. I dare say that it's a crime that the main story doesn't revolve around this more interesting character, and at the same time, the story doesn't grant any more opportunity for him to better express his perspective or resolve. Much of the focus is built on transforming the protagonist into a medium to project graphic art. Anything that affects the supporting cast, including this one, are moreorless apparent consequences from the central focus: to demonstrate true horror.

## Overexplanation

What does tend to be repeated is often unnecessary. Such as the banter. One time, it's enough. Twice, it's a recurring joke. Thrice, or often more, it's just adding too many words to a story that doesn't use its volume properly. The time taken to squeeze as much interruption of discussion between characters in such little time is not constructive, it's awkward and pointless. This is especially glaring when it's noted that the entire story takes place acrosss about three weeks, save the epilogue. It doesn't demonstrate a believable narrative that this much banter, horror, stress and death is all possibly executed in a matter of weeks, all caused by the protagonist and deus ex machinas. But perhaps the true purpose of the story is a demonstration of ambivalent human reaction to destruction, not consistent construction to a core theory.

# Overall, Avoid This Novel

So in the end, with the most interesting assets, being the duo's drawn cutscenes, being the most memorable parts, this is all I intend to hold and lock up for archive, with this post as a warning to ultimately avoid the entire story, which isn't worth rereading or sharing.

Thanks for your time, reader.
