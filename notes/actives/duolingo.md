# My Info

# Maintain that streak!

Complete a lesson or practice session sometime in the afternoon.

Streak freezes hide the illusion that breaks are inevitable and sometimes necessary.

When recovering from a streak freeze, the next practice lesson from a notification is significantly easier, a quick practice session.

## Incentives

Practice before noon or after 6pm for a potion that increases experience gain on the next lesson.

Daily quests acrue monthly quest points for badges.

Experience totals account for weekly leaderboards with 29 other randomly selected Duolingo users in the same league and language plan.

Completed units can be repeated again for more badges, at the cost of a different currency type.

Bages and leaderboards are entirely for momentary pride.

[^1]: Without payment, the entire curriculum of Duolingo is still accessible, but a heart system is in play, restricting use of the app for each incorrect answer, refillable over time or after completing certain challenges. Practice without hearts is possible, but some practice modes like speaking and listening are restricted to the paid plan.
[^2]: Voice-speaking exercises are only accessible on mobile apps or Chromium-based PC browsers, because Duolingo has not implemented support for microphone access on Mozilla and other privacy-based browsers.
