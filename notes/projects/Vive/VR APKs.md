Tags: [[virtual reality]] [[HTC]] [[android]] [[XR Elite]]

The HTC Vive XR Elite headset is capable of sideloading Android apps to be launched in the headset.

For most apps, these are simple panoramic projections with minimal touch screen support.

However, supposedly, there are some open VR apps that support simple VR experiences.

# Instead of APK apps

Consider WebXR experiences using the Wolvic app.
