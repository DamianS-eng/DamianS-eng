# So How Are We?

The united States has experienced accelerated economic growth and full employment with no discernable effect from restrictive monetary policy.

The true cause of U.S. robustness owes to fortuitous suplly-side factors: higher productivity growth & surge in available labor.

Emerging policy risks such as rollouts of tariffs and restrictions on immigration offsets gains.

# And the rest of the world?

Depends. Global inflation is 2%. The path to disinflation is uneven. Most developed markets endure monetary-policy-induced slowdowns.

They suffer from muted external demand, weak productivity, and the lingering effects of the energy crisis.
