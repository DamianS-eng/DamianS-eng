You don't know about the Steam Controller.

But let's agree on one thing:

This is like an Xbox controller.

The truth is that Valve sucked at introducing people to the Steam Controller.

Everyone knows what an Xbox controller is, so they cannot help but use that as their baseline to judge the Steam Controller.
