# About the detriments of Steam Input

I'd rather not include these in the project at all, but may as well get these thoughts down.

## Yes, Steam Input has limitations.

Especially as the Action Layers are put to their tests

## Yes, Steam Input has broken and incomplete features.

Even with the incorperation of gyro modes, it is impossible to convince Steam Input to output only the yaw and roll axes to a 2D plane, for the purpose of using a controller sideways. We cannot use a single Joy-Con with gyro rotated 90 degrees; this is already done when a pair are connected and combined, but pointless if the game is mouse-only or requires less than 4 buttons and one stick.

Similarly, it is currently impossible to rotate the analog axes of sticks, such that left-right movement on one stick outputs to up-down movement on another. An example of application is a SCHMUP with a screen turned 90 degrees, but perhaps games can interpret this outside Steam Input...

Spin Rhythm XD does an excellent job incorperating Steam Input Actions into their official configuration while providing more powerful gyroscope options than the official Steam Input gyro configuration can provide.
