A supplement to a guide on how to import your own custom music in the VR title Catch & Release using the in-game radio.

> The audio file must be converted to .ogg format

1. Convert audio file to `.ogg` format.
2. Locate the directory.
  - On Windows, `Documents\My Games\Catch & Release\Music`
3. Create a new folder inside the above.
  - Optionally, create multiple folders (these are the radio stations)
4. Insert audio files in created folder(s).
5. Enter the game, turn up the volume on the radio, and scroll the tuner. The radio should change to the name created for each new folder.
