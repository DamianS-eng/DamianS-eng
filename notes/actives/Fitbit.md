## Battery App

# Maintain

## Charge the Battery

The recommended solution is using a proprietary USB-A cable whose end to the device clamps around the back, with its gold pins lined up.

There's only one way for the clamp to rest onto the device in such a way that it will charge, but it is fiddly. Gently move the charger around the device until the device pops up with the charging battery meter, then release the clamp and set it down.

Charging time takes no more than 2 hours.

# App

Fitbit lasts for about 4-5 days on average without a charge.
