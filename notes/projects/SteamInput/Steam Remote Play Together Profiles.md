A guide on how to edit controller configuration profiles for use in Steam Remote Play

This works even if you don't own the game!

> This needs tests on the newest verison of Steam in 2026, as well as trial with Linux OS or Steam OS

# Prepare

If you own the game, just find it in your library, connect a controller and manage the game's controller configuration.

## I don't own the game

1. Add a non-Steam game
2. Choose a donor program (or blank script). It doesn't need to actually work.
3. Go into the added game's Properties, then rename the program to the App ID of the desired game.
   - To locate the game's app id, find it in the Steam store or use [Steamdb](https://steamdb.info).
4. Now, connect a controller and attempt to manage that 'game's controler configuration.

# Remote Play Together

The host needs to use the big picture overlay with the game.

As the client connects, a dialog window should pop up on the host, and they can choose to use the client's Steam account for the configurations.
