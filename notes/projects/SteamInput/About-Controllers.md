## How can I pair multiple controllers to my Steam Link?
You can pair a Steam Controller to your wireless receiver or directly to the Steam Link. To pair a Steam Controller directly to the Link, remove all USB peripherals from the Steam Link, boot to the blue pairing screen, and power-on the Steam Controller by holding "X" with the Steam/Home button. You can repeat these steps for pairing additional controllers.

## How can I use the Steam Controller in Bluetooth?

To toggle between pairing modes (the wireless receiver or Steam Link), press the Steam button while holding "A".
