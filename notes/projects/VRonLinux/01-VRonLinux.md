## Where to Move

> I am the lord thou OS, you shall not have any other OS besides me.
> Microsoft

Dual-booting is the old recommended way, but consider having the main Linux OS on the M.2, and dedicate Windows 10 and an NTFS portion on a separate SSD. 

1. Install a clean Windows 10 operating system.
2. Use a Live USB to boot into a Linux distro.

## Required Configuration

- Windows 10
  - Viveport
  - Vive-specific applications

- Linux Install
  - Fedora (Latest) w/ KDE Plasma Desktop

## SteamVR Games

### Steamdb / Protondb Setup

Once Steam and Steam VR are installed on the Linux OS, go to [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/profile) and submit the computer's specs. 

- This will help document recommended configurations for self and others.

### Titles not on Steamdb

- Glyph (delisted)
- Sparc (offline)
- Smashbox Arena (offline)
