I tried search to go round for any efforts to use the VIVE wireless kit on Linux.
The result is discouraging, but the most recent result I could find are 3 years old.
The main issue is that there is no clear indication of support for the custom driver that the wireless card uses on the Linux operating system.
I'm sure the windows only software could have a way of working in Linux with containerization, but the driver still needs to be working in Linux first.
