Of all the exercises designed to tailor the human body, the tasks aimed at the glutes could be the most challenging. No matter how fabulous your underwear is, if you have sagging issues or two flat pancakes, you’re going to want to start getting your backfield in motion.
In order to strengthen that ass, you have to work all the butt muscles, and there are three groups of them: 

1. the gluteus maximus,
2. the gluteus medius, and
3. the gluteus minimus.

It’s actually the body’s largest and most powerful muscle group. To get them awesome, it’s complicated, but not impossible. Often, glute-building exercises are left out of workout programs for guys (in favor of legs), but they shouldn’t be. The glutes are intricate to our pelvis; they keep our legs and torso aligned, and help to propel us forward. And if they look good, they leave a lasting impression to the admirers behind us.

Here are just a few simple butt exercises that are time-proven to get you on your way. 

## The Squat. 

This is the go-to exercise for your basic glute workout sans weights. It takes up very little space, and it’s relatively easy to do. 

1. Stand with your feet slightly wider than your shoulders.
2. Lower your back into a sitting position. Don’t let your knees go past your toes.
  - Remember to keep your chest up.

Repeat. Build up a number or reps with time.  Feel the burn.

## The Lunge Stretch.

1. Stand in place, then step forward and lower your back knee.
2. Make sure your knee is aligned with your ankle.
3. Stay in that position for 30 seconds on each side.
  
This move will help loosen the hip flexors, which will jump start the glute muscles.

## The Hip Thrust. 

1. Lie on your back and bend your knees. Make sure your feet remain flat on the floor, at the same width as your hips.
2. Tense your stomach and push your back against the floor.
3. Then raise your hips as high as you can, pushing with the help of your planted feet.
4. Hold for 20 seconds, then return slowly to the floor.

Keep going. You’ll feel it working almost immediately.

## The Knee Lift.

1. Stand before a box or a step.
2. With your left foot, step up to the box or step,
3. while your right knee moves toward your chest. It looks like you are about to climb up, but
4. instead, reverse: move your left foot back to the floor and now do the same move with your right foot.

Feel that nice stretch.

## The Skater. 

Visualize yourself skating on a frozen lake, and you got it. 

1. Find a small space to stand. Stand to the right of that space.
2. Squatting slightly, leap to the left of the space with one foot, as far as you can go.
  - Swing your arms to help you leap further. Don’t let your other foot touch the ground.
3. Now reverse: squat slightly and jump to the right of the space with your other foot.
  - Don’t forget to swing your arms.

Do this in a continual back-and-forth motion for as long as you can. 

> Get the heart rate up – it will help get your butt up as well.

Of course, there are countless more exercises to consider, but these five basic workouts will fire up the glutes and make them ready for more. Your body will thank you, and so will your admirers as you pass by.
