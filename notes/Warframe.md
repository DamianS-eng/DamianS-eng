Steps to get a Kubrow without purchasing anything in Warframe guide format for beginners only

Here is a beginner-friendly, **no-purchases** guide to getting your first Kubrow in Warframe.

## 1. Unlock the Kubrow quest

1. Progress your Star Chart until you open the Venus → Mercury Junction.  
2. Completing that Junction unlocks the quest “Howl of the Kubrow” in your Quests menu; start and follow this quest to get the Incubator segment. [1]

## 2. Get the Incubator segment

1. Finish the “Howl of the Kubrow” quest; one of its rewards is the Incubator segment for your Orbiter.  
2. Install the segment in your Orbiter when prompted so you can hatch Kubrows. [1]

## 3. Obtain a free Incubator Power Core

1. Keep progressing until you unlock and complete the Earth → Mars Junction on the Star Chart.  
2. This Junction rewards you with one Incubator Power Core, which is enough to hatch your **first** Kubrow without spending Platinum. [1]

## 4. Farm a Kubrow Egg on Earth

1. Go to forest tileset missions on Earth (any normal Earth mission with Grineer forest tiles).  
2. Look for wild Kubrow dens (burrow-looking objects) and destroy them; they have a chance to drop a Kubrow Egg. Eggs are a bit rare, so you may need several runs, but you only need one egg. [1]

## 5. Incubate your Kubrow

1. Return to your Orbiter and go to the Incubator.  
2. Select the option to hatch a Kubrow, using:
   - 1 Kubrow Egg.  
   - 1 Incubator Power Core (the free one from the Earth → Mars Junction). [1]
3. Start incubation and wait for the timer to finish; then claim your new Kubrow from the Incubator. [1]

## 6. Equip and level your Kubrow

1. Go to Arsenal → Companions and equip your new Kubrow.  
2. Take it on missions to level it up and start modding it as you get more Companion mods and resources. [1]

Follow these steps and you get a fully functional Kubrow companion purely through gameplay, with no Platinum or real-money purchases required.
