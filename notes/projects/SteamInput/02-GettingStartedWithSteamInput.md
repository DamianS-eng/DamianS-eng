## Chapters

	1. Third-Party
	Don't rely on Steam for unsupported controllers.

1. Launch Steam
   - Steam needs to be running to change the controller behavior.
   - It can run in the background, even if the game you want to play is not on Steam.

1. Choose a game
	1. Steam Game
	1. Non-Steam Game
	- Small warning about modern games with launchers from other publishers.
    	-- Destiny 2
    	-- VALORANT

	- Prefer to contribute to emulators supporting your controller instead of relying on Steam Input.

1. Set up the controller
	- Compatibility
