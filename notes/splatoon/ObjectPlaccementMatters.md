# Object Placement is important in Splatoon.

Do not stare too long at raw numbers and tier lists made by influencers. 

It's important to know why you place the placeable items in this game.

## wat

This is a small field guide with helpful hints on how to best place the throwable objects in this game.

If you're not sure which to read, try the ** obnoxious bold text. ** You'll jump up a rank following all that, guaranteed.

## Which Objects

* Autobomb

Aim behind an opponent outside the weapon range. Target has two choices to live: 

1. move away from you and bomb, gives you free room to breath and turf around, or
1. quickly move through bomb toward you. Especially for a close-range weapon, prepare for this and strike before they have a chance to attack out of movement.
1. Doing nothing is a free splat for you.

Place above ground. Walking autobomb can fall but cannot climb.

* Ink Mines

A B Matters

- Always
- Be
- Mining

* Big Bubbler

** DO NOT PLACE IN PATH OF TOWER. **

On the tower is pretty baller, just watch for flying Carbon Roller Decos.

Placement inside some enemy terrain is still useful, less closer to base.

Never stand between a target with a lethal sub and the outside of a Big Bubbler. 

Somewhere high-up still makes a decent Squid Beacon.

* Wave Breaker

** DO NOT PLACE IN PATH OF TOWER. **

Placement on tower is nice but predictable, especially for aggressive targets.

Place high up and behind small walls or solid corners.

* Tacticooler

** DO NOT PLACE IN PATH OF TOWER. **

Find a place in the middle of all teammates or slightly near the objective.

When in doubt, throw at your anchor.

If there's no anchor, be the anchor, and don't hog the Quick Respawn.

* Torpedo

** It sucks at inking terrain. **

Throw in suspected direction. If it pauses in mid-air, there's your target.

If it's shot down, he's aggressive. Be aware.

If it detonates, charge!

* Squid Beacons

Top-tier pro-strat placements are best, second best is literally anywhere near the objective.

Place with central mobility and some solid cover, out of the range of opponents.

Be aware of long-range or weird kits, like Sloshers. E-Liter may not pierce solid objects, but a good Explosher can shred objects around any cover.

Be flexible. Every player has different opinions on best Super Jump spots.

* Splat Bombs, Suction Bombs, Splat Walls, Point Sensors

Self explanatory.

* Angle Shooters

Go play some pool. Basic trigonometry and physics.[^1]

## Why Placement Matters

- Tracking

Knowing where your enemies are, or signaling 

- Pressure

Not always partial damage, but encouraging an opponent to move to the open area out of cover is still valuable. Perhaps not to you, but likely to your nearby teammate.

- Assistance

Splatoon isn't about K/D; it's about K+A/D.

## General Rule

* Throw once,* **no spam.**

## Overall Message

Don't waste your Subs and Specials.

Number used doesn't matter. Splats & Assists performed with each do.
