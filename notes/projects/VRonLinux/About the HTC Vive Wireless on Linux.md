I tried searching around for any efforts to use the VIVE wireless kit on Linux.
The result is discouraging, but the most recent result I could find is 3 years old.
The main issue is that there is no clear indication of support on Linux for ==the== custom driver that the wireless card uses.
I'm sure the Windows-only software could have a way of working in Linux with containerization, but the driver still needs to be working in Linux first.
