# GodMode9

Ensure that your 3DS modified with custom firmware has access to this tool.

> You can only back up the last GBA game you played on the 3DS, so only one game at a time can have its save data backed up and loaded.

## Backup Save

1. Launch the game you want to back up, let the game load, then exit to the home screen and turn off the 3DS.
2. Hold the start button and press the power button to turn the 3DS on to launch GodMode9 (GM9).
3. Select "SYSNAND VIRTUAL."
4. Select "agbsave.bin."
5. Select "AGBSAVE options..." on the bottom screen.
6. Select "Dump GBA VC save."

Now the save will be stored on "gm9/out" on the SD card!

## Replace Save

1. Ensure that the save file you want to inject is on the SD card, along with the 3DS able to launch into GodMode9 from power.
2. Launch the game you want to back up, let the game load, then exit to the home screen and turn off the 3DS.
3. Hold the start button and press the power button to turn the 3DS on to launch GodMode9 (GM9).
4. Go to SD Card, then the folder where the save file is located (using the D-Pad and A buttons to navigate).
5. Hover over the save file, then press Y button to copy to clipboard. It should be indicated on the touch screen.
6. Back out to root using the B button several times, then select "SYSNAND VIRTUAL".
7. Select "agbsave.bin"
8. Select "AGBSAVE options..." on the bottom screen.
9. Select "Inject GBA VC save."

Now, the save file is replaced!
