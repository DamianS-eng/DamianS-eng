# Steam Input
Tags: [[Valve Steam]]
## The goal
Provide a complete playlist that explores and explains the fundamentals of Steam Input in a objective, concrete method.

## Does this already exist?

While there are plenty of YouTube videos and playlists that already exist which examine Steam Input and the Steam Controller in-depth, there are several problems across one or more of these sources:

1. Outdated 
	(Blue Big Picture Mode is gone.)
1. Rambling or Spiteful
1. Brilliant but incomplete
	- An emphasis for ideas on Steam Controller, not for concrete objective reference to Steam Input
1. Even today, still overwhelming to start

This is meant as an updated video playlist sink that anchors and links as much documentation about Steam Input as possible.

Back in 2016, Valve has promised an [effort to support every single controller for Steam Input](https://youtu.be/7l4SiAiKqqk), with an update to the old Big Picture that adds non-Steam-Controller controllers, starting with the Sony Playstation DualShock4 (PS4) controller, without any other driver or program on the PC.

On PC, there are still opinions about input that are underrepresented and assumptions that split the community, and Steam Input was designed in mind with the constraints and assumptions made about input in games. The goal is to translate as much input made possible by new technology to these games while maintaining or improving the games' performance.

## The Plan

### The First Step Video (Step 1, First Step, Getting Started)
  - The point of focusing on this is SEO. YouTube prioritizes the first and last steps in its algorithm before recommending playlists. Subscriptions spawn from this video.
	1. Grab a controller
		- __Which One?__
		1. Xbox
		1. Feature Complete
		1. Other
	1. Launch Steam
	1. Choose a game

		- __On Steam?__
			1. Check the controller compatibility
			1. Best Case: Steam Input API
			1. Sometimes: Turn it Off
			1. Next-best: Developer Recommended
			1. All Else: Template
       
		- __Non-Steam?__
			1. Controller or Keyboard?
			1. Mouse-Only Works well with some...
### The Playlist Outline (this video, top of the playlist, Step 0)
1. The Goal
1. Why This Video
1. The structure outlined here
	1. Steam Controller (less priority)
	1. Steam Link (low priority)
	1. Three groups of controllers
		1. First-Party Support
			1. Xbox 360 Controller (x-input de facto)
			1. Xbox One /  Series
		1. Feature Complete
			1. Steam Controller / Steam Deck
			1. Sony Playstation
			1. Nintendo Switch 
				- Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons (low priority due to beta support)
		1. All Others
			1. Third Parties
     		- __Pay attention to how they are designed.__
				1. Output Xbox
				2. DirectInput
				3. Keyboard (not supported in Steam Input)
			1. Old Nintendo Controllers
	1. DualShock4 (the priority)
	1. The Gaming Mode
		1. Layout
		1. Guide Button, Quick Access & Shortcuts
		1. How to switch to Desktop Layout
	1. The Desktop Layout (and how to get to settings)
		1. How to switch to Gaming Mode
		1. Account for menu settings that rely on Gaming Mode
	1. Controller Configurator
		1. Overview (VERY basic, don't go into menus, show what it does, how it works, and how to disable)
 		1. Basic Changes (recommended layouts, templates, and quick access)
		1. Deeper Dive (explore into the configurator)
      - Rename Bindings (for non-Steam-Input-API configs)
   		- Types of outputs
        - Keyboard
        - Mouse
        - Xbox Controller
        - System
        - Camera
   		- Button Types
      - Action Settings
      - Action Sets & Layers
		1. Desktop Layout
 		1. Guide Button Layout

## Editing

- Script
- Steam Input Footage
	- Use OBS, less Steam Game Recording, controller overlay w/ DS4
- Timemarks
	- Especially userful for YouTube Timestamps
- Links
