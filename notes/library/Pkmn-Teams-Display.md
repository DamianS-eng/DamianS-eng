# What this is

As it becomes less important to bring old creatures to newer generations, it's an imperative issue to preserve teams in the game or generation they are in, but have a way to access them visually.

Instead of accessing each save files, show a selectable menu of all save files, and see the top team for that game/generation at a glance.

## Why is this important

Up until Generation 7 (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), Game Freak has vowed to make it possible to carry over and use all previous Pokemon from previous generations into newer titles. However, that promise has been broken.

Starting in Generation 8, only mons that are hard-coded to be in the game are allowed to be transferred to that title. This is independent of that generation, whether or not forms, moves or attributes have co-existed in the same generation. In addition, titles that were imported one way still cannot go back.

Pokemon Bank WAS a proposed official solution, but was replaced by Pokemon Home.

Pokemon Home is NOT the overall solution, but rather a solution that benefits Game Freak more as a recurring source of income for those desperate to get back the initial promise. While all previous 'mons are preserved in a large bank-like database, they sometimes cannot be used at all if a future game that supports them does not exist, because they can only go back as early as Generation 8/9 (Sword/Shield and Let's Go), but only if the game allows them to go there.
